# FEUP-AED2 - NaviGraph

Repository for the second project of the [Algorithms and Data Structures](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/ucurr_geral.ficha_uc_view?pv_ocorrencia_id=520316) course, at [FEUP](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/web_page.inicial).

## Objectives of the Project

The main goal of the project is to develop a flight management system for a global air travel network, allowing one to visualize several statistics of the network, calculate the best flight option, etc. For this purpose, we have to convert the network information, from the dataset to a graph and use several graph algorithms, heavily based on depth-first and breath-first searches.

## Instructions to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the following commands on the terminal:
    ```
    cd feup-aed2                   # Open project
    mkdir build && cd build        # Create and open build directory
    cmake .. && cmake --build .    # Build project
    ./feup-aed2                    # Run project
    ```
